  <div align="center">
👀 I’m interested in almost everything regarding personal computer and coding, i am very curious and usually try to learn something new everytime and everywhere i can, right now after the improvement of the languages i currently know i am exploring the world of videogame modding because i would like to create a mod or participate in a project as a hobby and as a way to improve my coding abilities and possibly learn a new language 
    </div>
    <div align="center">
🌱 I’m currently improving my knowledge of the languages listed below and choosing a new language/framework to implement

⚡ Fun fact: sometimes it happens that i leave my desk and my PC and go see what's new in the world or try different things (it sounds weird i know) and as a matter of fact i discovered that other than coding i am an appreciated cook and human being 😁
